// Strategy
// Complexity: 1/3, Popularity: 2/3

/*
 * Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that turns a set of behaviors into objects and makes them interchangeable inside original context object.
 * The original object, called context, holds a reference to a strategy object and delegates it executing the behavior. In order to change the way the 
 * context performs its work, other objects may replace the currently linked strategy object with another one.
 */

/*
 * Usage examples: The Strategy pattern is very common in TypeScript code. Itâ€™s often used in various frameworks to provide users a way to change 
 * the behavior of a class without extending it.
 * Identification: Strategy pattern can be recognized by a method that lets nested object do the actual work, as well as the setter that allows 
 * replacing that object with a different one.
